## Introduction | From Code Management to Decision Governance

In the AI-native era of engineering, we face a fundamental paradox:

**Our tools are becoming increasingly intelligent, yet our systems are growing increasingly uncontrollable.**

Traditional software engineering is built on determinism.
Engineers write every line of logic and bear explicit responsibility for system behavior.

However, once large language models (LLMs) enter the development workflow, this premise begins to collapse.
AI is no longer merely a tool for accelerating input; during implementation, it continuously makes **a vast number of small but high-impact decisions** on behalf of humans. Accumulated over time, these decisions ultimately shape the true form of the system.

## The Core Crisis | The Silent Loss of Decision Authority

When a system’s architectural direction, interface definitions, and logical boundaries are implicitly generated by AI—while human engineers merely “accept the result”—the system becomes structurally fragile.

This fragility does not stem from insufficient model capability or occasional hallucinations.
It arises from a deeper problem:

> **Decision authority has quietly slipped away from those who bear responsibility.**

When authority is decoupled from responsibility, engineering loses its basis for governance, and systems lose long-term stability.

## The VPC Principle | Reclaiming Engineering Sovereignty

The VPC Principle (**Verdict · Permission · Boundary Control**) is not another form of prompt engineering, nor a minor refinement of existing development workflows.

It is a **governance constitution for software engineering in the AI-native era**.

VPC requires us to redefine the division of labor between humans and AI, elevating the role of engineers from “executors” to “legislators”:

- **V · Verdict**
  Engineers define high-responsibility decisions that cannot be overridden—the laws of the system.

- **P · Permission**
  Engineers explicitly authorize the scope within which AI may make autonomous decisions—the operational boundaries.

- **C · Boundary Control**
  Engineering systems automatically monitor whether execution oversteps its authority—the sentries of governance.

## Why We Write This

When code can be generated cheaply and at massive scale,
what is truly expensive and scarce is no longer implementation capacity.

It is **human decision intent**.

The goal of the VPC Principle is to fully decouple **intent from implementation, and law from execution**:
to allow AI to operate efficiently within explicitly granted authority,
while ensuring that humans always retain final judgment.

This is not only about writing more robust code.
It is about reclaiming sovereignty over complex systems in the AI era.

> **In the AI era, engineers do not write code.
> They write the laws under which code is allowed to exist.**
